# Deep_learning_SoC
This project implements deep learning stack and a representative classifier using VectorBlox MXP, a Soft Vector Processor .

#Instruction to build and test the application
- Build the source code with MXP libraries and Zynq 7020 BSP
- Program the FPGA using MXP softcore bitstream.
- Run the application using xmd
- The runtime will be printed on serial console if the board is connected with UART cable and baud rate is set to USB2 baud rate
